# Photo listings
Been a bit slow with updating the last two weeks, but here are some new listings.

On june 20 I went out to listen for Common quail. At the end of the recording
it sounds a bit strange - it's two quails singing in stereo with a slight time
shift.

And on midsummer I went out birding together with Calle and Marc. The new
listings from that day are:

{% include image.html url="assets/img/Småtärna.jpg" description="Little tern" %}
{% include image.html url="assets/img/Göktyta.jpg" description="Eurasian wryneck" %}

And most importantly, the Lesser black-backed gull - whose swedish name
"Silltrut" contains herring ("sill") which is an important ingredient on
midsummer.
