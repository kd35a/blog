# Photo listings
As I assumed, June brought some additions.

## Little egret
I've photographed Little egrets [previously on Mallorca](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/555921621),
but now one happened to appear close by home here in Sweden.

## Collared flycatcher
During midsummer BBQ, a Collared flycatcher decided to pay the party a visit.
Some harsh light in the evening, but still able to work out what species it is.

## Wader bonanza
There are a lot of waders migrating currently, giving me the chance to see both
Little stint and Curlew sandpiper for the first time.
