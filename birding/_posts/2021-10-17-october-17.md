Week 41 is a popular week on Öland to look for migrating birds. So I was out a
short stint yesterday, and today I went out all day together with Carl. There
was unusually few passerine birds this weekend from my understanding, but I did
catch some new species.

And: a very good number 150 on the listing: Red-breasted goose!
