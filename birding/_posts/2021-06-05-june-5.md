# Photo listings
Went out for a Friday after-work and a night in the tent north of Kalmar along
the coast. There were two very active Common cuckoos. In the morning we got a
visit from a European green woodpecker by the campsite, but it was very good at
hiding behind trees and in bushes, so no good picture of it unfortunately. Also
found two Black woodpeckers, giving me the opportunity for an improved picture.

# Summary for May
May was a very fruitful month, with 38 new birds. With the additional Common
cuckoo that lands us on 111 species so far.
