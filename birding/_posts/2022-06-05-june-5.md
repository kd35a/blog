On the morning of Thursday I went out to look for a Black redstart that was
known close to where I live. The one I saw is most likely a 2nd calendar year
male, rather than a female, since it was singing very clearly from a roof top
for a good while.

And yesterday, when visiting Växjö, I went to search for a Black-necked grebe
that had been seen a couple of days earlier. Gladly it was still present.
Unfortunately I had to view it against the sun and at probably 500-600m out
into the lake, so the images aren't any wall-hangers.
