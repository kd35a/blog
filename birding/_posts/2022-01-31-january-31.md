# Photo listings
January yielded three new listings.

On the 9th I saw a Hen harrier quickly pass by:

On the 29th, when looking through a flock of geese, a Peregrine falcon came by
and made a couple of attack dives against the geese, but flew quickly away
again. The camera was dialed in for some resting and slowly foraging geese,
thus the slow shutter speed and resulting fuzzy image:

And finally, on the 30th, I saw some Pink-footed goose:

{% include image.html url="assets/img/Spetsbergsgås 2.jpg" description="Pink-footed goose - touch-down! But seems like some of his friends thought the landing was a bit clumsy and moved away..." %}
