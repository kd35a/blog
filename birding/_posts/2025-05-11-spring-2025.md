# Photo listings
Here are some new photo listings from the spring of 2025. Since last time I've
moved to Karlstad, Värmland.

## Bar-headed goose
Carl and Marc came visiting, and of course we went out birding. Not what I had
expected as my first new listing after moving to Värmland, but I was just as
happy, and with great company.

## Great reed warbler
Along my commute to work, there's apparently a Great reed warbler that has returned
to the same spot for a couple of years. First tried finding it in the morning
without success, but on my way home I found him singing!
