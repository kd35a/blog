# Photo listings
This years second quarter hasn't ended yet, but I've gathered more than enough
new listings to justify a new blog post.

## Grey Partridge
When visiting my dad in Skåne, I took the opportunity to search for Grey
Partridge that had been reported. First I found the one that someone else had
already reported, and when biking back I found another one by myself.

## Hornsudden
On April 1 I went to Hornsudden to get a better view of the migrating birds.

A Mediterranean gull had been found in Kalmar, so I went to take a look at it.

## Nothern gannet
This one was found in a lake about 1 hour drive from home, and has stayed there
for about 1,5 week by the time of writing. A bit strange.
