# Photo listings
Finally, after lots of frustration, yesterday I got a decent photo of the very
common Eurasian magpie. There's even two of them that have been building a nest
in the tree outside my office window. But so far there's always been lots of
branches and other irritating things making the images less good than what one
would expect from such a common bird.
