# Photo listings
Here are some new photo listings from summer and fall of 2024.

## Parasitic jaeger
On July 7 Carl, Marc and me went to Beijershamn looking for waders. Not too much
fancy that day, until parasitic jaeger caused commotion among the terns and
flew right over our heads.

## European bee-eater
When going down to Skåne, I took the opportunity to swing by a group of nesting
European bee-eaters on July 11.

## Rock ptarmigan
On August 10, Hanna and married, and directly after the wedding we went to Åre
for some well needed rest. When hiking up Åreskutan on August 15, Hanna spotted
a Rock ptarmigan that was a very cooperative photo model. A much appreciated
wedding gift!
