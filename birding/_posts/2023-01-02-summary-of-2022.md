# Photo listings
First, I managed to squeeze in some last listings at the end of 2022:

# Statistics
2022 gave me 43 new photo listings, giving me a total 203.

And here's a graph showing the number of new listing by week number.

To summarize, the complete graph since I started in 2021 looks like this:

## Experiences
This year I focused a lot more on birding in my local area, rather than heading
to some "hotter" place. Looking at Artportalen, it's fun to see that I have 162
species of birds listed in Kalmar municipality for 2022 (that number includes
some birds I wasn't able to document, like Red-throated loon), which is more
than I saw in total in 2021.

Focusing my birding to my local area has made me much more aware of what
different habitats exists in my vicinity.

The bird experiences I hold most dear from this year was when I found a
[Short-eared owl back in April]({% post_url birding/2022-05-01-may-1 %}), and
when going to [Ebbegärde kronopark together with Carl and Marc]({% post_url birding/2022-03-14-march-12 %}).

## Thanks
Going out birding with other people always makes the experience better, it's
more fun to share the joy! Thank you Hanna, Carl, Marc and Staffan for your
great company while birding this year.
