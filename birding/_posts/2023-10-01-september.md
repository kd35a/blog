# Photo listings
Some new listings for september.

## Lesser kestrel
A lesser kestrel showed up on Öland for about two days, and I got home just in
time to see it the last evening.

## Full day on Öland
Went together with Calle for a full day of birding on Öland, and got three new
listings! Almost four, we saw a Razorbill in the spotting scopes, but he dove
before I got a photo, and was not to be seen again.

### Golden eagle
This one has eluded me for a long while. I have seen it and photographed at
least two of them in 2020 before I started my list. And when culling through my
Lightroom library, I found out I apparently photographed one in 2021, but it
didn't register at the time (don't be hung-over while birding...). But now,
finally, two adult ones.

### Corn bunting
I've photographed a corn bunting [previously on Mallorca](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/555917281),
but now also here in Sweden.

### Northern hawk-owl
This one was equal amounts luck and good timing. We were about to head home, and
Calle quickly checked Artportalen if anything interesting had been reported but
no bird alarm sent. A report from 1h earlier of a Northern Hawk-owl stood out -
let's give it a try.

About 2km driving distance - or 900m as the crow/owl flies - from where it had been
reported, I see a glimpse of the owl from the corner of my eye. I instinctively
yell for Calle to stop the car.
