# Photo listings
Todays post will gather this weekends sightings. I got a half-decent photo of
the European green woodpecker, and two bad photos of Red-backed shrike and a
Montagu's harrier. The Red-backed shrike photo lacks sharpness because of heat
haze, and the Montagu's harrier was very far away.

Montagu's harriers are an endangered species in Sweden, so I've stripped all
[Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) from that photo to give away as
little as possible.
