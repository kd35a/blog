First of: the [Goshawk from April 16]({% post_url birding/2022-04-18-april-18 %})
is apparently not a Goshawk, but a Eurasian sparrowhawk after some [discussions
on Artportalen](https://artportalen.se/Image/3855328).

On an after work birding session on Wednesday I saw a bunch of Little ringed plover.

And on Friday, when I thought birding was over for the day and poured myself a
cup of tea, this Short-eared owl came out of nowhere. Was gone just as quickly
as he/she emerged.
