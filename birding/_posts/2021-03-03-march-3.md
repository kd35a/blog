# Photo listings
Went out today on a walk and happened to see a Eurasian bittern, which was a
glad surprise!

Also forgot to add my last listing from February, so here it comes:

# Summary for February
February didn't contribute with too much, 4 new listings. This gives a total of
49 listings. Today's listing of the Eurasian bittern is included in the graph
below.

The big difference in additions is probably because:
* Majority of all common species were quickly added
* Same season as January, so no new species coming in
* It's a shorter month - probably the main factor! ðŸ˜‰
