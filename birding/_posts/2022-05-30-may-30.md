# Photo listings
The last couple of days have brought a lot of new sightings. All of these were
found thanks to great help from Calle who has tirelessly teached me a lot on
how and what to listen for in bird songs.

These first three birds were photographed during a three day hike with Calle,
Hanna and George on Ostkustleden during the long weekend of Ascension Day
holiday.

Later on I found these two birds on my own, thanks to Calles teachings.

During the hike I also got a greatly improved observation of a European honey
buzzard, compared to [the one from last year]({% post_url birding/2021-08-04-august-04 %}):
