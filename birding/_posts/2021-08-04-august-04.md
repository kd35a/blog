# Photo listings
Some new listings from the last couple of days.

{% include image.html url="assets/img/Bivråk.jpg" description="European honey buzzard" %}
{% include image.html url="assets/img/Skräntärna.jpg" description="Caspian tern" %}
{% include image.html url="assets/img/Storspov.jpg" description="Eurasian curlew" %}

The Eurasian curlew was just a happy find, when I was hunting for a Red
phalarope. Unfortunately it was laying resting between some Black-headed
gulls very far away (~300m), so it's not identifiable by photo and
therefore not a listing I count.

And finally a European nightjar, one among a bunch, that I found infront of my
car on the road. I only had my phone with me, so the picture isn't the best,
but good enough to identify the species.
