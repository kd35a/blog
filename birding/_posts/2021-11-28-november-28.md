# Photo listings
Yesterday demanded probably the biggest dedication so far for a listing. 4.5h
one way in the car, driving all the way to Vargön to see Swedens second confirmed
Siberian rubythroat ever. For this drive I had the wonderful company of Marc.

On the way back we also stopped in Falköping to see some Pine grosbeaks.
