# Successful photo listings
Today I went out with the goal of catching a Grey heron, but they were all
tucking their heads in. Instead I can add some new birds to my list, and get
an improved photo of the Eurasian coot.

The following birds were seen, but either I didn't catch a photo or the photo
didn't make the cut.
* European robin
* European crested tit
