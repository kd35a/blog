# Photo listings
Yesterday Jonas tipped us about a Ring-necked duck by Ek√∂. No luck then, but
we made another try today which was successful! While out we also saw Water
rail.

And today I'll also include probably my lowest quality listing so far, taken
yesterday, a Common kingfisher. It's so bad it needs two photos to paint the
complete picture... sorry, I'll see myself out.
