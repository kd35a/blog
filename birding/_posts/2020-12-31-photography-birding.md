title: "Photography birding - a beginning"

During 2021 I want to try out birding/listing, where each species must be
accompanied with a photograph. The photographs should aspire to be
[quality images](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Image_guidelines#Quality_and_featured_photographic_images),
rather than artistic or "wow" images.

The photos should have a high enough quality to convince a beginner (read:
_myself_) with images from a field guide that, yes, indeed this is a bird of
the specified species.
