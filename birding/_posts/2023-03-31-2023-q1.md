# Photo listings
I've been a bit slow with updating the blog with my latest listings, so now
with the current quarter ending I thought it would be a good idea to summarize.

## Eurasian eagle-owl
I won't go into details on this listing, since it's a vulnerable species in
Sweden.

## Great grey shrike
Had planned to search for owls in Ebbegärde Kronopark with Carl, but didn't
find any. Instead this Great grey shrike showed up!

## King eider
Early morning in March with the first southern migration winds, I finally got
to see a King eider.
