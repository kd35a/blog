# Photo listings
Today I went out birding with Carl and Hanna in Bottorp/Hagbyhamn. It didn't
bring any new listings, but greatly improved photos of these two species. First
of a Eurasian hobby ([previous photo]({% post_url birding/2021-07-27-july-27 %})):
{% include image.html url="assets/img/L채rkfalk 2.jpg" description="Eurasian hobby" %}

And secondly a Spotted redshank ([previous photo]({% post_url birding/2022-06-19-june-19 %})):
