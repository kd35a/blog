# Photo listings
On December 19 I had a close encounter with a Tawny Owl, and got a proper photo
for this years listing project!

Yesterday, December 25, during a christmas day walk, I saw a European rock
pipit.

And finally, today, on a second walk to the same place, there were a bunch of
Twite foraging for food.
