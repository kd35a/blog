# Successful photo listings
Went to Bottorp today for a walk. The only new listing is a Bohemian waxwing:

Apart from that there were most notably lots of Fieldfare and 8 resting
White-tailed eagles.

# Summary for January
Now at the end of the month it's maybe a good time to summarize the photo
listings journey so far. In total there's 45 species listed.

The lowest quality so far is the Common kingsfisher from jan 30, that needed
two photos to somewhat convincible. Definitely hope to get a better photo of
that one some day.

The highest quality listings in my opinion so far are, in no particular order:
* Mute swan ([1/1]({% post_url birding/2021-01-01-new-years-day %}))
* Eurasian blue tit ([4/1]({% post_url birding/2021-01-04-january-4 %}))
* European robin ([4/1]({% post_url birding/2021-01-04-january-4 %}))
* Great spotted woodpecker ([4/1]({% post_url birding/2021-01-04-january-4 %}))
* Eurasian treecreeper ([9/1]({% post_url birding/2021-01-09-january-9 %}))
* Rook ([11/1]({% post_url birding/2021-01-11-january-11 %}))
* House sparrow ([17/1]({% post_url birding/2021-01-17-january-17 %}))
* Ring-necked duck ([30/1]({% post_url birding/2021-01-30-january-30 %}))
