# Successful photo listings
Many of these photos are of borderline quality. Good enough to identify the
species, but with too much noise (damn you Swedish winter darkness), bad angles,
bad light direction or motion blur (again, damn you Swedish winter darkness).
There's room for improvement. The Mute swan takes home the price as best photo
of the day.
