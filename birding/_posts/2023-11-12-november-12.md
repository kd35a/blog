# Photo listings
I went to Ölands Northern Tip together with Calle for a full day of birding on
5th of November.

## Razorbill
I've seen a razorbill before, but never been able to document one. Finally one
flew by close enough while migrating! Here, following some Long-tailed ducks.

## Northern pintail
I was looking through old listings, and realised I forgotten to add Northern
pintail to my blog! This was from an outing with Calle on 15th of January this
year.
