# Photo listings
For ascension day/weekend we went out to hike on Ostkustleden for two days.
This meant that I slimmed down a bit on camera gear and only took the 70-300mm
kit-lens for telephoto, and it shows in the technical quality of the images.
The species is identifiable at least, but I hope to get some better images in
the future.
