Last weekend I visited my dad in southern Sweden and saw five Sandwich tern
and two Spotted redshank.

And yesterday I went out together with Calle to listen for a Corn crake. We
heard him repeatedly and clearly, but he was of course hiding very well in the
tall grass.

While visiting my dad, I got a notification that a Walrus had been sighted in
the area. So of course I had to go and see it for myself:
