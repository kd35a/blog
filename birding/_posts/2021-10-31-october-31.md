# Photo listings
This one has been bugging me a few weeks, and will not perfectly fit my goal
of doing photo birding, but it's close enough. I've heard a Tawny owl calling
from my apartment a few times, but never with the ability to record. And later
I've heard potentially the same individual in an other place quite close by on
evening walks.

Always when I've tried to record the sounds, or try to search for it in
  daylight, the owl is completely gone.

But today, my luck came!

And to accompany the sound, I add an old image from the archives of 2019.
