This weekend we had the pleasure to borrow Jonas cottage on south easter Öland,
which we very thankful for! One of the goals was to go [birding]({% post_url birding/2021-01-17-january-17 %}).

But this cottage is also situated in a [Bortle class 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortle_scale)
area. Having access to those dark skies literally at the doorstep of a warm
cottage, clear skies and a 6% moon called for some astro photo.

In the center you can clearly see the [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy).
[M110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_110) is to the right of the
galactic nucleus. [M32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_32) looks a bit
weak though. [Nu Andromedae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_Andromedae) is
also easy to see.

# Technical details

I've made some unsuccessful attempts previously at taking stacked deep-sky
object photos, but failed so far. This is the first successful attempt!

The image is taken with a 17-50mm ƒ/2.8 lens on a regular tripod. Here's the setup:

| Focal length | 50mm |
| Aperture | ƒ/3.2 |
| ISO | 6400 |
| Exposure time for light frames | 200 * 2s |
| Dark frames | 50 |
| Flat frames | 50 |
| Bias frames | 50 |

The raw photos were stacked using [DSS](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/index.html),
and then lightly post-processed in [Siril](https://www.siril.org/) (stretching,
background extraction) and cropped.

There's definitely some room for improvement. The image seems to be a bit out of
focus, which should be solvable with a [Bahtinov mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahtinov_mask).
And the post-processing can definitely be improved, there's still a lot to
learn there.
