Last year I took my [first successful photo]({% post_url astro/2021-01-17-andromeda-m31 %})
of the [Andromeda galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy). And
yesterday I improved a lot in my second try. This time M110, M32, Nu Andromedae
and 32 Andromedae are all clearly visible.

# Technical details

The image is taken with a 300mm ƒ/4 lens on a regular tripod. Here's the setup:

| Focal length | 300mm |
| Aperture | ƒ/4 |
| ISO | 8000 |
| Exposure time for light frames | 699 * 1/2s |
| Dark frames | 50 |
| Flat frames | 50 |
| Bias frames | 50 |

The raw photos were stacked and then post-processed in
[Siril](https://www.siril.org/). First used Photometric Color Calibration to get
color correction, then auto stretching with manual tweaking. After that some
background extraction, and finally some last tweaks in Lightroom.
